                        <li>
                            Measure accurately. Baking is as much science as art, 
                            if not more so. Invest in a digital scale and an oven 
                            thermometer for the best results.
                        </li>
                        <li>When melting chocolate &amp; butter, ensure the mixture 
                            is not exposed to any liquid.
                        </li> 
            
                        <li>Before adding eggs to the butter &amp; choco mixture,
                            remember to cool the mixture down. If not, you will 
                            get scrambeled eggs in your batter!
                        </li> 
                        <br>
                        <li>While adding in eggs into a hot mixture is definitly a
                            horrible idea, adding sugar into a hot mixture is great!
                            <ul type="square">
                                <li>
                                    This is a great way to melt your sugar and avoid having 
                                    sugar crystals in your baked brownie, hence allowing the 
                                    brownie to have an even distribution of sugar.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li> 
                        
                        <br>

                        <li>When whisking in eggs, remember to patient and fully whisk and 
                            mix fully before adding in the next egg. This will allow your 
                            batter to come together faster and more efficiently.
                        </li> 
                        
                        <li>
                            Cocoa powder is an optional ingredient when baking brownies, 
                            but when included, your brownies will have an extra rich and 
                            intense flavour.

                                    Cocoa powder is also a key ingredient to 
                                    making rich and chewy brownies!
                                </li>
                            
                                <li>There are also differences within types of 
                                    cocoa powder. All the types are just a product of 
                                    different methods use to process cocoa. There are 2 types, 
                                    dutch-process and natural. </li>
            
                                    <br>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Dutch-Process: washed in alkaline soluton of potassium carbonate.
                                            This neutralises the cocoa beans' acidity, causing it to be neutral, 
                                            Dutch-process cocoa powder is unable to react with baking soda, so 
                                            add in baking powder instead! Since Dutch-processed cocoa powder dampens 
                                            sharp flavours so when baking, remember to get a good brand. 
                                        </li>
            
                                        <li>
                                            Natural: acidic and bitter, with a very strong and concentrated chocolate
                                            flavour. As it is acidic, most recipes use baking soda to allow the combo to
                                            act as a leavener.

                        <li>
                            Folding is a technique that is often used when you don't want 
                            to overwork your batter and deflate the air in your batter.
                            If your batter is overworked, you will have a batter with too much gluten. 
                            This will affect the structure of your brownie, giving it a heavy, bready texture.
                        </li>

                            Additions/ toppings such as nuts, chocolate pieces or fruits of your preference
                            may be added for an extra boost in the texture/ flavour for the brownie. 
                        </li>

                            The bake time may vary depending on your type of brownie and oven. The general
                            method is using a toothpick to test if the brownie is ready. Generally, brownies 
                            are ok if they're slightly underbaked, and it is much better to underbake your brownies 
                            than to overbake them, because you may obtain a dry brownie instead.

                    <ol>
                        <li>When making cakey brownies, include baking powder &amp; 
                        Dutch-processed cocoa powder.</li>
                        <li>Be sure to let the brownies cool before you cut and serve them. 
                            When they first come out of the oven they'll be like chocolate cake; 
                            but as they cool they settle, and "cake" becomes "dense cake" â€” the 
                            perfect cake-type brownie.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>If your fudgy brownie doesn't have the perfect level of 'fudginess', 
                        add more butter and chocolate gradually. Alternatively, decrease the flour ratio</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>For this recipe, using dutch processed cocoa is recommended as the recipe
                            mimics boxed brownie. </li>
                        <li>However, this can be substituted by using only 1/4 cup of 
                            unsweetened regular cocoa powder.
                        </li>
                        <li>Preferrably, use granulated sweeteners such as erythritol or monk fruit 
                            sweetener, but using regular sugar is fine too! </li>
                        
                    </ol>

                <ul><li>VEGAN BROWNIES: </li></ul>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Coffee enhances the chocolatiness in chocolate and deepens the rich flavor 
                            (without tasting like coffee). If you don't have espresso powder, you can 
                            substitute with instant coffee powder (use slightly more, about 1 &amp; 1/4 to 
                            1 &amp; 1/2 teaspoons).</li>
                        <li>Since vegan diets do not include eggs, your choco-butter mixture does not need 
                            to be cooled too much. Mixing in the rest of the ingredients to a slightly warmer/ 
                            higher temperature mixture will not cook anything. </li>
